# Deployed state

Written by `npm run deploy` (`scripts/deploy.sh`). Do not edit by hand — if
this disagrees with the live site, trust the site and re-run the deploy.

| **Commit** | `2bebb94` — Merge branch 'robots-edge-note': robots.txt edge-toggle note |
| **Bundle** | `assets/index-CKwrcYMs.js` |
| **Worker version** | `a3ad483c-935c-4fc9-b4da-9ffe02ea896c` |

Verified at deploy time: core tests pass, CSP present in the shipped HTML and on
the live response, Tab 0 "Born" date baked from the true root commit, both URLs
serving the bundle above, and **no third-party beacon on `/` or `/methods`**
(checked with a browser user-agent — the injection is UA-gated and invisible to
a plain curl).

The live console should be **clean**. Any third-party script request is a §6
regression, not an expected warning.
